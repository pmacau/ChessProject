# My Personal Project



## **Questions/Answers and some Information about the Project** 
- ### ***What will the application do?***
It will show you a chess piece on a board, and then you have a 1-7 seconds depending on difficulty
to memorize the board, and then the board goes blank, and you have to correctly recall what positions and potentially 
what side (black or white), 
and what exact piece is on the square (bishop, knight, etc). Normally, it would start
off with 1 piece, and each time you correctly recall, another  random piece appears which you will have on top of the prior piece to 
memorize. And this will go on and on, till all the squares of the board you choose are taken up (this could be adjusted according to difficulty)
or till you incorrectly recall. 
So it is essentially a memorization chess based game. The game will have an in-game stats page on the main menu, 
to showcase achievements of the player. 

- ### ***Who will use it?***
People who like puzzle memorization games, or people interested in chess such as myself.
Also, there doesn't have to be too much time commitment to play, you could a have a few minutes to spare
and solve a few levels. 

- ### ***Why is this project of interest to you?***
I always liked doing memorization recall games, and I also enjoy playing chess, and I thought
that combining the two would make for a fun, and potentially more applicable game than usual tile recall games, at 
least for me. As remembering chunks of the board in chess is very important when attempting to generate potential lines
(moves) while looking in the future and comparing positions from potential future vs now. However, this might
not be one-to-one to recalling chess chunks (areas on the board), since the positions generated might
be very obscure to what you'll have in a real game, however, this might actually be an advantage, as it is 
more difficult to recall patterns which don't follow any line of logic (as it will be randomly placed), potentially
making board recall more intuitive over time, which could be applied to the real game.

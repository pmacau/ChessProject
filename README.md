## **Questions/Answers and some Information about the Project** 
- ### ***What will the application do?***
The application will be a 2D dungeon floor game, starting at floor 1, 
and going to 10 levels. Each floor getting progressively more difficult,
with more and more challenges. Not every floor will be 
inherently unique, some floors will simply just be iterations of past floors,
however tweaked to make it more difficult. Beating floor 10, means
you beat the game, and have the option to restart. Each time you beat a floor
you earn a certain amount of gold, with the gold you can buy items
in an item shop between levels that may help you in certain situations. If you 
get eliminated on a level, you have the option to either quit the game, 
or restart. 


- ### ***Who will use it?***
Individuals who like dungeon floor based games, and have some free time on their hands. 
The great thing about it is that it does not require much time investment, and can cater 
to people
who don't have much free time, yet individuals who do still have the option to play for 
however long they please. 

- ### ***Why is this project of interest to you?***
I always really enjoyed games which had little mini-games bundled
together, as each segment would have a totally new environment and challenges, 
and the nature of the game would allow this to happen in quick succession. An 
example would be a game I've played called Pummel Party, where you compete against friends in 
mini-games (and has some board-game features). So I've always sort of been interested in 
this sort of genre.

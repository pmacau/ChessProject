# My Personal Project



## **Questions/Answers and some Information about the Project** 
- ### ***What will the application do?***
It will show you a chess piece on a board, and then you have a 1-7 seconds depending on difficulty
to memorize the board, and then the board goes blank, and you have to correctly recall what positions and potentially 
what side (black or white), 
and what exact piece is on the square (bishop, knight, etc). Normally, it would start
off with 1 piece, and each time you correctly recall, another  random piece appears which you will have on top of the prior piece to 
memorize. And this will go on and on, till all the squares of the board you choose are taken up (this could be adjusted according to difficulty)
or till you incorrectly recall. 
So it is essentially a memorization chess based game. The game will have an in-game stats page on the main menu, 
to showcase achievements of the player. 

- ### ***Who will use it?***
People who like puzzle memorization games, or people interested in chess such as myself.
Also, there doesn't have to be too much time commitment to play, you could a have a few minutes to spare
and solve a few levels. 

- ### ***Why is this project of interest to you?***
I always liked doing memorization recall games, and I also enjoy playing chess, and I thought
that combining the two would make for a fun, and potentially more applicable game than usual tile recall games, at 
least for me. As remembering chunks of the board in chess is very important when attempting to generate potential lines
(moves) while looking in the future and comparing positions from potential future vs now. However, this might
not be one-to-one to recalling chess chunks (areas on the board), since the positions generated might
be very obscure to what you'll have in a real game, however, this might actually be an advantage, as it is 
more difficult to recall patterns which don't follow any line of logic (as it will be randomly placed), potentially
making board recall more intuitive over time, which could be applied to the real game.


## User Stories  
As a user,
- I want to see my highest streak of puzzles solved.
- I want to see my attempts be added and tracked to statistics. 
- I want to see how many puzzles I've solved in total. 
- I want to see what difficulty I play most. 
- I want to be able to select what difficulty I want to play from the start. 
- I want to be able to have puzzle modifiers, that can amplify standard difficulty,
specifically, being able to make it so they're random colours (white or black), so you 
have to memorize the sides of the pieces as well. 
- I want to be able to have a modifier where a piece takes another piece in the next
progression of a board (potential reach). 
- I want to see what pieces I guess right most in statistics. 
- I want a mode in which I can add whichever pieces I want onto a board in a 
"self memorize" mode rather than the "normal" mode (in which was described prior). 
I want a modifier that makes it so only one side can spawn, or potentially more sides, more than just
black and white. 
- I want the difficulties to give a certain amount of lives (attempts that you can get incorrect with resetting).
